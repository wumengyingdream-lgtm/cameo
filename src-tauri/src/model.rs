//! Board data model — the serde shapes that persist in `<folder>/.cameo/board.json`
//! and cross the IPC boundary to the frontend.
//!
//! Invariants (PRD §4, decisions D6):
//! - **Asset** is immutable + content-addressed (blake3). Originals are never
//!   rewritten; every op mints a new Asset.
//! - **Placement** is the mutable, non-destructive presentation of an Asset on
//!   the canvas. Lineage lives in `parent_id`; `x/y` is computed at placement
//!   time, then owned by the user.
