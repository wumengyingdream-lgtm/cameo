//! Runtime-agnostic event stream. The Codex adapter (codex.rs) translates Codex
//! JSON-RPC notifications into `UnifiedEvent`s; everything above the adapter
//! consumes only these, keeping the runtime swappable (Codex now, others later).
//!
//! This is the deliberate swap boundary — there is one concrete runtime today,
//! so we keep the abstraction at the event shape rather than a premature trait.
